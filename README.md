## Setup Instructions

### 1. Start Docker Compose

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed. Navigate to the project directory and start the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This command will build and start the necessary Docker containers in detached mode.

### 2. Generate Test Data
   Once the containers are up and running, generate the test data using fixtures. Execute the following command:
   
```bash
docker-compose exec php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```
This command will load the test data into the database.

###  3. Create a User
   Create an initial user by running the following command:
```bash
   docker-compose exec php bin/console app:create-user --email="sample@email.com" --password="supersecret"
```
Replace sample@email.com and supersecret with your desired email and password.

###  4. Access the Client Interface
   You can access the client part of the application in your browser at:
http://localhost:8080/

### 5. Access the Admin Interface
   To access the admin interface, open the following URL in your browser:
http://localhost:8080/admin

## Additional Commands
### Stop Docker Containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### View Docker Logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```
